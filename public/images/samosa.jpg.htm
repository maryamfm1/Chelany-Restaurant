Each of our chefs has at least 5 years of professional experience in India. Many of our dishes are soaked in sauces for up to 2 days to gain aroma. We use over 50 different spices to give the delicacies a unique taste and for many of our culinary creations we use the traditional tandoori, a stone oven that provides a slightly smoky, spicy note.
